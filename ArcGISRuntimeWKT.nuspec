        <description>This is a unit-tested C# library that can convert Well Known Text (WKT) / Well Known Binary (WKB) to and from ESRI's ArcGIS Runtime Geometry.

The motivation for this library is a no-dependency and small footprint WKT/WKB parser. It has some limited-functionality but is a alternative to more robust but bloated libraries such as SharpMap

This library is to be used in conjection with NuGet package Esri.ArcGISRuntime for .NET</description>
        <releaseNotes>This is an alpha release. The following WKT and WKB are not supported at this time: MultiPoint, GeometryCollection, CircularString, CompoundCurve, CurvePolygon, MultiCurve, MultiSurface, Curve, Surface, PolyhedralSurface, TIN, Triangle</releaseNotes>
        <tags>wkt, wkb, arcgis, ersi, geometry, map, runtime, convert, parse</tags>
